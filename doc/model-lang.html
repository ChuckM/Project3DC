<h1>P3DC Model Description Language 1.2<br>
<font size="2"><em>Copyright © 1997-1999 Charles McManis, all
rights reserved.</em></font></h1>

<p>This document describes the 1.2 version P3DC model description
language used by the 3D rendering engine in my library. The
notation is EBNF with the following meanings:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Terminals (things you type) are boldfaced and colored
        blue.</li>
    <li>Optional productions are enclosed in square brackets '[',
        ']'.</li>
    <li>Productions that can repeat end with asterisk '*'</li>
    <li>When a choice of productions must be made they are
        separated by vertical bar '|'</li>
    <li>Nonterminals are written in all UPPER CASE</li>
    <li>Constants are floating point numbers acceptable to the
        function atof(3)</li>
    <li>Comments begin with the hash (#) character and continue
        to the end of the line.</li>
    <li>Whitespace (space, tab, newlines) delimits names and
        keywords.</li>
    <li>Keywords and names are case <em>insensitive.</em></li>
    <li>Most keywords can be abbreviated to their first letter,
        the exceptions are LINE, LIGHTMAP, DETAIL, and DECAL
        which need three letters in order to be unique. </li>
    <li><em>All</em> names exist in the same name space so you
        cannot name a texture &quot;<em>base&quot;</em> and also
        name a color &quot;<em>base&quot;</em>.</li>
    <li>Names must start with a letter and can only contain the
        characters in the set [a-zA-Z$_] and they are limited to
        a maximum length of 63 characters .</li>
</ul>

<p>Models begin with a model keyword and a name, their bodies are
enclosed in braces. Model descriptions may not be nested but may
be several to a file. The model namespace is flat in P3DC
therefore you are not allowed to have two models named cube for
example. </p>

<h2>An Example Model File</h2>

<p>This example file describes a textured cube. As you can see it
assumes the texture for the cube is layed out in a cross topology
(think about what it would look like if you unfolded all of the
cube sides.) There is also a specification for a lightmap (which
creates an illumination effect on the top and bottom.) The light
map could have been part of the same texture file however if you
wish to use the same file as both a light map and a base texture
(obviously you have to use different parts of the texture for
this!) then you can do that by assigning the same texture to the <em>base_texture</em>
and the <em>lightmap_texture</em> attributes when the model is
instantiated. (see usage below)</p>

<p>Another important point to remember is that faces are
specified with their vertices in counter-clockwise order. This
determines the &quot;front&quot; for the face where the texture
will appear. You can have different textures and/or colors on
both the front and back of a face, just specify the face twice,
once with the textures one way and once with them the other way.</p>

<p><img src="cube-verts.gif" align="right" hspace="5" width="150"
height="161">The cube was chosen as a good example as it is easy
to visualize and understand. The file stdmodels.3dc will
eventually have standard models for all of the basic shapes,
cube, cone, sphere, pyramid, cylinder.</p>

<p>As you can see in the picture at the right, the cube has eight
vertices. In the first versions of the library each side (or
face) of the cube had its own set of vertices, this allowed each
side to have unique texture co-ordinates but it also meant that
to transform the cube into my 3D world I needed to transform 24
vertices! (6 sides x 4 vertices each). Now I transform 8 vertices
and I'm done. This is an example of where not doing something
(transforming extra vertices) makes things a whole lot faster.</p>

<p><img src="cube-face.gif" align="left" hspace="5" width="205"
height="161">This cube still has six faces, I've colored one in
the picture at left to show you an example of one. This face is
defined by the four vertices <em>V2</em>, <em>V8</em>, <em>V6</em>,
and <em>V3</em>. Note that if you were on the right hand side of
this cube and looking at it straight on, those vertices would be
in counter clockwise order. It is not important which vertex is
first and last in the list, so we could equivalently use the
vertices <em>V3, V2, V8, </em>and <em>V6. </em>And get exactly
the same face, but if we reverse the order to be clockwise then
we would be defining the face on the <em>inside</em> of the cube.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a previous version of this language I assigned a name to
each face, after implementing the language I found the name to be
redundant and so have deleted it from the specification. The
things that are named however (things like colors and textures)
are named so that they may be changed when the model is
instantiated by the library. Ok, so lets look a the model
definition as it would appear in the file.</p>

<pre><font color="#008000">#
# Definition for the CUBE model
#
</font><font color="#0000FF">model</font><font color="#008000"> </font><font
color="#400000">cube</font><font color="#008000"> </font><font
color="#0000FF">{</font></pre>

<p>The non-comment line should be the keyword <strong>model</strong>
followed by the name of the model. Since all models share a
single name space if you had several variations of cubes you
might call this one <em>unit_cube</em> instead of just <em>cube</em>.
Note though that you can change the cubes overall dimensions when
the cube is instantiated.</p>

<pre>    <font color="#0000FF">origin</font> <font
color="#0000FF">=</font> 0, 0, 0 <font color="#0000FF">;</font>
    <font color="#0000FF">color</font> base_color <font
color="#0000FF">=</font> 0, 255, 0 <font color="#0000FF">;</font>
    <font color="#0000FF">color</font> highlight <font
color="#0000FF">=</font> 255, 0, 0 <font color="#0000FF">;</font>
    <font color="#0000FF">texture</font> base_texture <font
color="#0000FF">= decal, wrap ;</font>
    <font color="#0000FF">texture</font> light_map <font
color="#0000FF">= lightmap ;</font></pre>

<p>The next few lines define a catalog of attributes for the
model, the first, <strong>origin</strong>, defines where the
center of the model is in its local 3D model space. This is the
point upon which the model with rotate or turn when you use the
model api in the library to change its attitude. This is also the
point of the model that can be precisely located when you use the
<em>p3dc_locate_model</em> function. The origin does not have to
be a vertex or even within the bounds of the model.</p>

<p>Following the origin there are two colors defines, one named <em>base_color</em>
and the other named <em>highlight</em>. You can assign different
color names (and defaults) to the model using these statements,
later when the model is instantiated the colors can be changed
with the <em>p3dc_model_set_color</em> function.</p>

<p>Finally there are two lines defining textures, one called <em>base_texture</em>
and one called <em>light_map</em>. (note that the spelling is
changed to prevent it from being confused with the keyword
'lightmap'). When the model has been instantiated you will load
textures and then apply them using the names from the model file
and the api call <em>p3dc_model_set_texture</em>. </p>

<pre>    <font color="#0000FF">vertex</font> V1 <font
color="#0000FF">=</font> -0.5, -0.5, -0.5 <font color="#0000FF">;</font>
    <font color="#0000FF">vertex</font> V2 <font color="#0000FF">=</font>  0.5, -0.5, -0.5 <font
color="#0000FF">;</font>
    <font color="#0000FF">vertex</font> V3 <font color="#0000FF">=</font>  0.5,  0.5, -0.5 <font
color="#0000FF">;</font>
    <font color="#0000FF">vertex</font> V4 <font color="#0000FF">=</font> -0.5,  0.5, -0.5 ;
    <font color="#0000FF">vertex</font> V5 <font color="#0000FF">=</font> -0.5,  0.5,  0.5 <font
color="#0000FF">;</font>
    <font color="#0000FF">vertex</font> V6 <font color="#0000FF">=</font>  0.5,  0.5,  0.5 <font
color="#0000FF">;</font>
    <font color="#0000FF">vertex</font> V7 <font color="#0000FF">=</font>  0.5, -0.5,  0.5 <font
color="#0000FF">;</font>
    <font color="#0000FF">vertex</font> V8 <font color="#0000FF">=</font> -0.5, -0.5,  0.5 <font
color="#0000FF">;</font></pre>

<p>After the attributes the eight vertices are defined, they are
named <em>V1</em> through <em>V8</em> (not very interesting I
know). As you can see they define a cube where the corners are
between -0.5, -0.5, -0.5 and 0.5, 0.5, 0.5. </p>

<p>Take a moment to consider what that means, it means that the
center of gravity of this cube is 0,0,0 (half way between all the
points). Alternatively you could put all of your vertices between
0 and 1 and then set the origin to 0.5, 0.5, 0.5. The latter
works, however when you scale the model on instantiation, the
origin <em>doesn't move</em>. so if it isn't at 0,0,0 you will
get some unexpected (but predictable) results.</p>

<p>Finally we get to define some sides and they appear as
follows:</p>

<pre><font color="#008000">#
# side faces
#</font>
    <font color="#0000FF">face</font> &lt;base_texture&gt; (base_color) 
                  V1 &lt;64,192&gt;, V2 &lt;128, 192&gt;, V3 &lt;128, 255&gt;, V4 &lt;64, 255&gt; ;
    <font color="#0000FF">face</font> &lt;base_texture&gt; (highlight) 
                  V2 &lt;0, 128&gt; , V7 &lt;64, 128&gt;, V6 &lt;64, 192&gt;, V3 &lt;0, 192&gt; ;
    <font color="#0000FF">face</font> &lt;base_texture&gt;  
                  V5 &lt;64, 128&gt;, V6 &lt;128,128&gt;, V7 &lt;128, 192&gt;, V8 &lt;64, 192&gt; ;
    <font color="#0000FF">face</font> &lt;base_texture&gt; 
                  V1 &lt;128, 128&gt;, V4 &lt;192, 128&gt;, V5 &lt;192, 192&gt;, V8 &lt;128, 192&gt; ;
<font color="#008000">#
# top and bottom faces
#</font>
    <font color="#0000FF">face</font> &lt;base_texture, light_map&gt; 
		  V4 &lt;64, 64&gt; &lt;0, 0&gt;, V3 &lt;128,64&gt;&lt;0,255&gt;, 
		  V6 &lt;128,128&gt;&lt;255,255&gt;, V5 &lt;64,128&gt;&lt;255,0&gt; ;
    <font color="#0000FF">face</font> &lt;base_texture, light_map&gt; 
		  V1 &lt;64,0&gt;&lt;0, 0&gt;, V8 &lt;128,0&gt;&lt;0,255&gt;, 
		  V7 &lt;128,64&gt;&lt;255,255&gt;, V2 &lt;64,64&gt;&lt;255,0&gt; ;
<font color="#0000FF">}</font></pre>

<p>As you can see from the lines above the faces are simply
statements that collect vertices into groups (faces) and place
textures on them at particular co-ordinates. </p>

<p>The texture co-ordinates in this case are going from 0 to 255
which is a Glide standard however in the very near future they
will go between 0 and 1.0 for the full texture. This makes
understanding their mid-points etc easier. (and it is Glide 3
compatible so that is a bonus.)</p>

<p>Finally the model description ends with a closing brace '}'
which tells the parsing function that there is no more model to
parse.</p>
