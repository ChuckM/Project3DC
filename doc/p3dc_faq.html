<p>There are a bunch of on-line 3D Graphics resources, I have
listed some <a href="#RESOURCES">here</a>. And I am also
maintaining a <a href="#BOOKS">reccomended book list </a>for
people who want to start building a library of books on 3D
graphics.</p>

<h2>The current answers:</h2>

<p><a name="Q1">Q) </a><strong>What is the P3DC Library?</strong></p>

<p>A) This library is my attempt at a 3D engine that is
sufficiently flexible for me to &quot;play around&quot; with 3D
games programming and 3D experimentation. I've read for years the
Graphics GEMs books (highly reccomemended) and been unable to
&quot;try out&quot; the most of the suggested gems because I had
no environment I knew well enough to hack around it. I was also
somewhat intimidated by the learning curve of Direct3D (and
somewhat less so for OpenGL). </p>

<p>Q) <a name="Q2"><strong>Can I use this code in my Commercial
Application?</strong></a></p>

<p>A) Yes. The code is covered under a BSD style license. (it
qualifies as &quot;Open Source&quot;) See the file license.txt in
the distribution.</p>

<p>Q) <a name="Q3"><strong>Would I want to use this code in my
Commercial Application?</strong></a></p>

<p>A) Probably not, these days OpenGL is a much better choice as
it runs on a wide variety of platforms and is well supported. My
stuff is fine for learning one way that you might approach the
problem of building a 3D engine but even I am never satisfied
with it (that's why I'm on version 5 and climbing!)</p>

<p>Q)<a name="Q4"> <strong>Why did you write this library?</strong></a></p>

<p>A) So that I could speak intelligently about the issues of
writing 3D games.</p>

<p>Long boring version :</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>I started writing graphics programs in 1982 using a PDP-10
    and a Tek 4010 storage scope, and a PDP-11/55 with a COMTAL
    video frame buffer attached. Fun but the hardware required a
    air-conditioned machine room. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Then in 1984 I bought an Amiga 1000 and had fun writing
    programs for it (a lot cheaper but limited colors). Between
    1987 and 1995 I didn't write any graphics code. In 1995 I
    bought an Edge3D board for my PC (used Nvidia NV1 chip) but
    could never figure out how to program it! (Nvidia was a pain
    to work with at the time and Direct3D version 1 was a TOTAL
    joke)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>In 1996 I bought a Diamond Multimedia Monster 3d (Voodoo
    Graphics) based 3D accellerator for my (upgraded) PC. I tried
    to write a Direct3D (V2) program and between the bugs in D3D
    the arcane syntax/calls/overhead I gave up in disgust. Then I
    found the 3Dfx Glide library and when 2.4 was released I
    decided I'd see if I could write a program to rotate a 3D
    cube. It took a while but by mid '97 I some code that could
    rotate a textured cube. Yippee! </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Of course this code could not do anything else :-(. So I
    bought the latest copy of Computer Graphics Principles and
    Practice, dusted off my old Neumann &amp; Sproul Principles
    of Interactive Computer Graphics, and dug out my old ACM
    Siggraph papers and went to work. The result was
    &quot;Chuck's Graphics Library&quot; which could be used to
    render flat shaded objects in a 3D world with a fixed field
    of view camera. I rechristened the project the Generic 3D
    library (G3D) in late '98 and rebuilt it twice more (versions
    2, and 3) and got to the point where cameras were getting
    flexible and I wanted to do animation. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Then in late '97 and early '98 I rewrote it a fourth time
    (G3D-4) and got the polygon count up to 50-75K polygons a
    second on a 200MX Pentium and Monster 3D, added textures and,
    with the help of my 7 yr old daughter, embarked on making a
    3D game. I ran into one roadblock after another and decided I
    had the wrong architecture still, so I ripped it apart and
    rewrote it again. That brings us up to the present with
    version (version 5) which I rechristened <em>again</em> to
    &quot;Project: 3D Craft&quot; because there were already
    engines named G3D and that confused people.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Then I took sort of a forced break while the startup I'm
    in heated up, and now (Aug 99) its back together again and
    running with textures and a much more flexible model
    architecture.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Q) <a name="Q5"><strong>How fast is this library?</strong></a></p>

<p>A) That depends on many things, not the least of which are the
speed of the processor and the type of interface. The target for
the library is 130K polygons/second on a P5-200 with a Voodoo1
card. That would give me a budget of approximately 3K polygons
per frame at 30FPS (We have to allow some time for game AI,
sound, etc) But even this number is inaccurate because a scene
could have 10K polygons and still work at 30FPS if only 3K of
those polygons were &quot;visible&quot; and ended up going down
the pipeline to the display. </p>

<p>The short answer is that I've got several game ideas cooking
and it should be sufficient for all of them. None of them comes
close to the complexity of Unreal :-). </p>

<p>Q) <a name="Q6"><strong>What operating systems does it run on?</strong></a></p>

<p>A) Windows95 and FreeBSD (Linux would be an easy port).
Currently there isn't any Glide support under FreeBSD so it
renders to a file. When I can get the Glide libraries to work
under FreeBSD there will be a FreeBSD version.</p>

<p>Q)<a name="Q7"> <strong>Does it have to use Glide?</strong></a></p>

<p>A) No. All of the actual &quot;rendering&quot; code goes
through a &quot;Graphics Abstraction Layer&quot; (gal) that has
to support what Glide supports however P3DC programs never
&quot;know&quot; they are talking to Glide, they only know they
are rendering graphics. I've written an alternate GAL layer
(gal_text) that generates PNG files for example. If you're
motivated and want to enhance gal_text.c to do texture mapping
that would be pretty cool.</p>

<p>Q) <a name="Q8"><strong>Why didn't you just use OpenGL?</strong></a></p>

<p>A) Because I learn by building and I had to build a 3D engine
to understand it. By using Glide I've got a pretty good device
driver abstraction to work with. If you're just writing a game or
something and either already know or don't care to know how 3D
engines work, I reccomend you use OpenGL. </p>

<p>Q) <a name="Q9"><strong>How long did it take you to write
P3DC?</strong></a></p>

<p>A) I've been working on it in my &quot;spare&quot; time for a
couple of years now. However the bulk of the time spent on it was
late 97 to mid-98. Then I spent the middle of 98 thinking about
how to re-write it and in August 1998 embarked on Version 5. Then
there was a long pause and I picked it up again in August of
1999.</p>

<p>Q) <a name="Q10"><strong>Do you work on 3D graphics
professionally?</strong></a></p>

<p>A) No, I write and modify operating systems (generally UNIX
based) and design Internet appliances.</p>

<p>Q)<a name="Q11"> <strong>I've modified P3DC to handle [some
feature] can I distribute it?</strong></a></p>

<p>A) Yes, any code you write you own and you can do whatever you
want with it. However you are bound by the P3DC license to
include my copyright statement where you put your own copyright
statement (manuals, documentation, etc) </p>

<p>Q) <a name="Q12"><strong>Would you consider including my
feature in the library?</strong></a></p>

<p>A) Certainly, the beauty of open source is that anyone and
everyone can contribute and make it better. I do retain change
control on the final &quot;product&quot;, anything can be placed
in the &quot;contrib&quot; directory. </p>

<p>Q) <a name="Q13"><strong>What versions of Voodoo card (Glide)
does P3DC support?</strong></a></p>

<p>A) My main development machine now has a Voodoo2 in it,
although for a long time I was using a Voodoo Graphics (sst1) in
the form of a Diamond Monster 3D. I'm using version 2.x of Glide
because it has the most stable support for Voodoo Graphics, I'll
probably write a <font face="Times New Roman"><tt>gal_glide3.c</tt></font>
layer and then be able to compare the to but I've been leary of
doing that given the problems with its support of Voodoo
Graphics.</p>

<p>Q)<strong> </strong><a name="Q14"><strong>What other hardware
are you planning on using?</strong></a></p>

<p>A) Recently, NVidia released C code that would talk directly
to their TNT and TNT2 engines. This seems pretty cool so I may do
a gal_tnt.c backend for them as well.</p>
