<h1>Project: 3D Craft -- Datastructures</h1>

<p>One of the things I've discovered in writing and re-writing
this library is that the way you structure the data has a huge
effect on how easy or how hard it is to do things. I remember
from college waaay back when this was told to me but somehow it
didn't sink in. I would say that the most time spent so far on
version 5 has been in crafting new data structures to work with.</p>

<h2>Basic Types</h2>

<p>The first seems pretty trivial but isn't, that is the <a
name="p3dc_FLOAT"><strong>p3dc_FLOAT</strong></a> type. It is
typedef'd as a float which seems somewhat redundant however the
idea is that by changing this you can change the library from
single precision FP to double precision FP. Presumably you could
even change it to fixed point but you would need compiler support
in that case because I have not special cased the math functions
(add, subtract, multiply, etc) In practice it isn't that simple
to convert the library (I've done it as a test), but it is
possible.</p>

<p>Next up in the basic types is structure that holds two
co-ordinates. It is called a <a name="p3dc_PNT"><strong>p3dc_PNT2</strong></a>
(point 2) and consists of two p3dc_FLOAT members named <em>u</em>
and <em>v</em>. I chose <em>u </em>and <em>v </em>because this
structure is most often associated with textures and textures are
defined in terms of a <em>uv</em> space to keep from confusing
them with the <em>xy</em> space of the screen. Here a page of <a
href="p3dc_PNT.html">things you can do</a> with a <strong>p3dc_PNT2</strong><em><strong>
</strong></em>type variable.</p>

<p>Two more types in the point family are <strong>p3dc_PNT3</strong><em><strong>
</strong></em>and<strong> p3dc_PNT4</strong>. The former has
members <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, and <em>z</em>, and the latter
adds the member <em>w</em>. The definitions are compatible so
casting a point-4 to a point-3 and referring to <em>y</em> will
change the member <em>y</em> in either definition. Point-3's
represent points in 3-D space, whereas point-4's are used to
represent points in a 4-D homogenous space. Because of this
converting to and from is fairly straight forward. Here is a link
to <a href="p3dc_PNT.html">things you can do</a> with <strong>p3dc_PNT3</strong>
and <strong>p3dc_PNT4</strong> type variables.</p>

<p>The next structure is a transform and is named <strong>p3dc_XFRM</strong>.
A transform has a 16 bit id tag associated with it and a four x
four array of floats. Transforms are stored in column major order
so that they are compatible with PHIGS transforms (I use the
PHIGS code to test my results sometimes). The <em>id</em> member
of this structure holds a monotonically increasing number that
uniquely identifies a transform. In the code, when a vertex is
transformed, the identifier of the transform used is stored in
the vertex and later, when the vertex is transformed again, if
the identifiers match then the previously computed result is
used. This speeds things up when you have static vertices that
are part of a scene and they are transformed every frame. There
is, of course, a wide variety of <a href="p3dc_XFRM.html">things
you can do</a> with a <strong>p3dc_XFRM</strong> typed variable.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most versatile data type in the library are nodes,
<strong>p3dc_NODE</strong>'s to be exact. These are a very useful
data structure and are used through out the library to hold
pointers to allocated memory, pieces of models, etc. The members <em>nxt</em>,
<em>prv</em>, and <em>parent</em> facilitate connecting nodes
together as either singly, doubly, or heirarchically linked
lists. When used hierarchically they are connected into a
red/black tree (a form of binary tree) and they use the <em>name</em>
member to identify nodes and the <em>color</em> member to help
keep the tree balanced. The &quot;payload&quot; of the node
consists of a type variable which is a defined enum of type <strong>p3dc_TYPE</strong>,
and a void pointer that points to the payload itself (which can
be another node of course). When I get into the discussion of <a
href="p3dc_memory.html">memory management</a> the versatility of
nodes will become clear. In the mean time there are many <a
href="p3dc_LIST.html">things you can do</a> with nodes.</p>

<p>The place where nodes are stored is called a <strong>p3dc_LIST</strong>.
The list structure maintains house keeping values associated with
a list of nodes, these include the <em>first</em> node on the
list and the <em>last</em> node on the list. Further, if the list
is being enumerated there is a <em>current</em> pointer that will
keep track of the last node seen. Additionally, lists can be <em>type
exclusive</em> which means they will reject having nodes added to
them that don' t match a particular type. This is very useful for
debugging purposes. You can read more about lists on the <a
href="p3dc_LIST.html">LIST page</a>.</p>

<p>The last of the basic types is the <strong>p3dc_CLR</strong><em><strong>
</strong></em>definition. This type defines a color in P3DC and
it is a union of both separate red, green, blue, and alpha
values, and one &quot;packed&quot; 32 bit RGBA value. There are
typedefs for big endian and little endian machines so the library
should port easily to those architectures. I chose the packed
format as it is simpler to move into and out of it, alternatives
were a floating point format where each color component has a
value between 0 and 1.0 but that can be too slow. The color APIs,
such as they are, are described in their own <a
href="p3dc_CLR.html">document</a>.</p>

<h2>Compound Types</h2>

<p>With these basic types, some compound types are created. Each
of the compound types gets its own page for clarity.</p>

<p>The first compound type is the <a href="p3dc_VRTX.html"><strong>p3dc_VRTX</strong></a>
type. This type defines what a vertex is in the library. Vertices
are used as the lynch pins that hold together polygons, lines,
and faces.</p>
