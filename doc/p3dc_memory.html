<h1>Project: 3D Craft -- Memory management</h1>

<p>Perhaps no aspect of C programming strikes more fear into the
programmer's heart than the dreaded &quot;Hey, it looks like
you've got a memory leak.&quot; So evil is this affliction it
created a multi-million dollar company in the form of Purify Inc.
Amazing isn't it?</p>

<p>I hate memory management so in this version of the library I
designed a set of tools that would manage memory for me in a way
that I hope will be robust and reliable. Also because we're doing
real-time 3-D graphics here it has to be <em>fast</em>.</p>

<h2><a name="DESIGN">Architectural</a> Design</h2>

<p>The memory subsystem was designed around the principle that
most of the time, the same things get allocated and deallocated
again and again. In particular the vertices, transforms, colors,
and lights are used and re-used while generating the scene.</p>

<p>One common technique of addressing this issue is to use
pre-allocated arrays of things that you use on a dynamic basis.
The problem with this technique is answering &quot;how many&quot;
things do you pre-allocate? However, for something like a game,
this technique can be useful as the answer to the question can be
determined empirically. This is done by playing the game and
fixing it when it runs out of space.</p>

<p>The pre-allocation technique is not acceptable in a more
general purpose engine because you don't know apriori how many
things will be rendered or changed etc. And yet the simple
technique of calling malloc/free each time is tremendously
expensive in terms of CPU time. (even the simpler malloc
libraries use non-trivial amounts of time.)</p>

<p>The solution I am currently employing and evaluating consists
of using malloc to force allocations but to never call free.
(Sounds like a memory leak but it isn't really :-)</p>

<p>I use the fact that as far as the engine is concerned, 99.99%
of the time the engine or the user will be allocating things of a
type already known to the engine so the allocator is designed
around the P3DC type structure. </p>

<p>The design is to allocate structures from the heap, and then
when deallocating them to put them onto a list so that they might
be used again later. When a subsequent allocation request is made
the structure is fetched from the free list. Currently, mallocs
are done on a 1:1 basis (one request, one malloc) but it is
possible to change this to malloc several instances in
preparation for future requests. The cost of this
'pre-allocation' is that when you reach a steady state you risk
having over allocated memory by the number of structures in your
pre-fetch size.</p>

<p>The key interfaces in this library are clearly <em>new</em>
and <em>free</em> however they manage chunks of memory by
allocating them as shown below.</p>

<p><img src="images/node-mem.gif" width="436" height="79"></p>

<p>The actual allocation is large enough to hold both a <em>p3dc_NODE</em>
structure and a structure of the desired type. Then the pointer
to the type is returned. Later, I can recover the node pointer
with simple pointer arithmetic and verify it to be valid by the
following test:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Does the <em>data.p</em> pointer in the node have the
        same value as the pointer I was passed?</li>
</ul>

<p>If they match I assume its valid. Note that this arrangement
also lets me recover the type of a <em>void *</em> pointer in
other places in the library too. There is a function <em>p3dc_get_type</em>
that does this.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>This function allocates a new structure of type <em>req</em>
    for the program to use. It first checks the free list to see
    if any unused structures are present, and if so uses one,
    otherwise it allocates a new structure + node from the heap
    and returns a pointer to sufficient memory to hold a
    structure of type <em>req</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>This function will free a structure previously allocated
    with <em>p3dc_new_type</em>. It does this by subtracting a
    value equal to about <font face="Times New Roman"><tt>sizeof(p3dc_NODE)
    </tt></font>from the pointer and looking for a <em>p3dc_NODE</em>
    structure there. Various sanity checks are performed then the
    structure is added into that node's free list for later
    reuse. For performance reasons it is added to the head of the
    free list and will be re-allocated on the next call to <em>p3dc_new_type</em>
    that needs this type of structure. The side effect of this is
    that dangling pointer problems are caught quickly.</p>

    function only works on things that have been allocated with <em>p3dc_new_type</em>
    above. If the pointer does not seem to have a node behind it
    then the function returns <font size="2"><strong>P3DC_UNKNOWN</strong></font>.</p>

    printed to the <a href="p3dc_log.html">log file</a>. If the
    value of <em>reset</em> is non-zero, the memory statistics
    are being reset. This feature allows you to wait for your
    application to reach steady state and then to dump out
    statistics to see that no new mallocs are being done.</p>
