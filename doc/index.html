the home page for <em>Project: 3D Craft</em><font size="2"><sup><strong>TM</strong></sup></font>
I hope you enjoy your visit. These pages are a combination of
things, they are a reference for the current implementation of
Project: 3D Craft, they are also a tutorial of sorts on 3D
programming (I say of sorts because they are more like a journal
than a tutorial), and they are sort of a living history as the
project evolves.</p>

<h2>Recent News:</h2>

<p>This version of these pages is dated Novt-11-99, if you would
like to be informed when changes are made please send mail to
(careful here &quot;p3dc-request @ home.mcmanis.com&quot; with
the body of your message simply the word 'subscribe.' I'll send
update announcements there.</p>

<p>There is a new demo/download that contains the program <a
href="downloads/scenetest.zip">SceneTest</a>. This program is the
multiple camera view demo (see the gallery for a screen shot).
Anyway, at 200KB it is smaller than downloading the whole
distribution and rebuilding from scratch.</p>

<p>Two notes:</p>

<ol>
    <li>It is only tested on Win95+Voodoo+3DFx drivers,
        Win98+Voodoo2+3Dfx drivers. If you run it on another
        config and it works let me know. See the file README.txt
        in the zip file for control notes. [The ESC key exits]</li>
    <li>It is pretty snappy on a monster machine, it is not
        nearly so snappy on a smaller machine. My two test
        machines are a 550Mhz PIII/VooDoo<sup>2</sup> and a
        400Mhz K6-2/VooDoo Graphics. (aka Voodoo 1)</li>
</ol>

<h2>Current Release Notes</h2>

<p>The complete release notes are available <a
href="release_notes.txt">here</a>.</p>

<p><em><strong>New/Fixed this release --</strong></em></p>

<ul>
    <li>I completely rewhacked how Cameras worked. They are
        documented <a href="p3dc_CMRA.html">here</a>. (also
        linked below in the table of contents.)</li>
    <li>Lighting is broken for points and lines. I figured out
        how to do it and its between models at the moment.</li>
    <li>More documentation is available. Now that cameras are
        done I'm probably going to work on the model
        documentation.</li>
    <li>Transparency works again (it used to work in G3D)
        although it isn't refined yet.</li>
    <li>A couple of new tests, cameratest and perspective that I
        wrote while figuring out cameras.</li>
</ul>

<p>As usual if you find problems or want to comment, feel free to
send me mail (cmcmanis on this server [mcmanis.com]) My daughters
are bugging me to write a game for them so I'm looking at doing
&quot;mazewar&quot; as a way of exercising the library. The
elements are there, all I need is to get them together into a
coherent package.</p>

<h2>Things to do and see. (aka the Table of Contents)</h2>

<ul>
    <li>For those of you are interested in using any of this code
        in a commercial project (heaven forbid) then you should
        read the <a href="license.html">license</a> first. It
        isn't very onerous (its &quot;Berkeley flavored Open
        Source&quot;) so don't worry. </li>
    <li>If you are interested in the kinds of scenes that I've
        rendered with this library (and others if they send them
        to me) you should probably check out the <a
        href="gallery.htm"><em>Gallery</em></a>. </li>
    <li>The source is available as either a zip file or as a
        gzipped tarball. Its about 2.5MB. There are two build
        trees, one for FreeBSD and one for Win9x (I use Visual
        C++ 5.x).<ul>
            <li><a href="downloads/p3dc.zip">p3dc.zip</a> -- A
                4MB zip file suitable for Win9x clients.</li>
            <li><a href="downloads/p3dc.tar.gz">p3dc.tar.gz</a>
                -- A 4MB gzipped tar file, suitable for BSD and
                Linux clients.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>There is the <a href="#WHATITIS">introduction</a> to this
        project below, and a fairly brief <a href="#HOWISTARTED">summary</a>
        of how I got to the point where I wanted to write a 3D
        engine in the first place.</li>
    <li>This engine uses 3D objects called &quot;models&quot; to
        populate the scenes. These are dynamically read from a
        Model Description Language (MDL) that is described <a
        href="model-lang.html">here</a>.</li>
    <li>I'm collecting questions and answers in the P3DC
        Frequently Asked Question (<a href="p3dc_faq.html">FAQ</a>)
        list.</li>
    <li>A snapshot of the library header file (p3dc.h) is <a
        href="p3dc.txt">here</a>. This is useful reference
        material in the discussion of the <a
        href="data_structures.html">Project 3D Craft --
        Datastructures</a> pages.</li>
    <li>A description of <a href="p3dc_CMRA.html">how cameras
        work</a> is now included.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The To-do List (or projects more or less in priority
order...)</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Probably top of the list is to get models
        documented/working the way I would like. This includes
        some pathing code to allow me to animate things in a
        useful way.</li>
    <li>The &quot;mazewar&quot; game, if only to satisfy my 9 yr
        old daughter who has already designed half a dozen levels
        for it.</li>
    <li>Transparent/Translucent colors.</li>
    <li>Rewhack lighting for points/lines and models. To do this
        I'll need an inverse transform point function to
        transform the lights into view and model space for more
        efficient lighting calculations. </li>
    <li>Lightmap textures and texturing in general. I've got some
        ideas on how to generate terrain without annoying
        repetition in its textures, I'll have to see how that
        works out.</li>
    <li>Re-whack this documentation to give it some semblence of
        coherency. Top level view - midleve discussions - api and
        implementation notes, plus as many &quot;this is what I
        have learned so far&quot; kinds of things.</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="WHATITIS">What</a> is &quot;Project: 3D Craft&quot;?</h2>

<p>Good question! (Ok so its a pretty obvious question.) For me
it is a journey, a journey of understanding the nuances and
subtlties that are 3D &quot;engines.&quot; Of course there is no
need to understand 3D engines these days, just use OpenGL or
DirectX, the machines people are buying are now fast enough that
pretty much anyone who can read documentation can put together
enough code to write a game or demo. On the other hand, while
writing games and demos are neat, I'm a systems guy who likes to
understand the insides of things. And there wasn't a whole lot
written on how to write a 3D engine for a game or a demo. One of
the better resources on the web for 3D engines is the <a
href="http://cg.cs.tu-berlin.de/~ki/engines.html">3D engines list</a>,
which lists this engine as well. Other resources are various
groups like the <a href="news:comp.graphics.algorithms">comp.graphics.algorithms</a>
and the game programming groups. Anyway, these web pages and this
engine represent the current point on my journey.</p>

<h2><a name="HOWISTARTED"><strong>Where</strong></a><strong> I
started ...</strong></h2>

<p>Basically I'm an engineer that has worked with and programmed
computers professionally since 1976. In 1977 I got
&quot;hooked&quot; on the personal computer and lusted mightly
for an Altair 8800 but instead bought a Digital Group Z80 system.
From the beginning I've been interested in graphics, in the
beginning it was characters on a TV set, then with a COSMAC Elf
kit that I purchased and built in 1982 I moved up to 128 x 64
&quot;pixels.&quot; </p>

<p>When I went to college I had access to a PDP-11 with an
attached frame buffer that would do 512 x 512 x 24bpp and that
was so awesome (but really slow, it took about a minute to load a
complete frame). There was also a Tektronix 4014 that was high
resolution (4096 x 4096) but only green &amp; black, then there
was an Apple ][ that had SubLogics 3D package on it, on that
system I could rotate a wireframe cube in 3D! Woo hoo! I had high
color, high resolution, and high speed, only they weren't in the
same system.</p>

<p>Graphics took on new meaning when I went to work at Intel and
worked on a graphics chip named the 82786 in 1984, it even has a
small on board processor that could draw lines and do
&quot;BITBLT&quot; (bit-blit aka Bit Block Transfers), further it
could pump out 1024 x 768 resolution at a time when a monitor
that could display that resolution cost $6000 from Barco. This
was speed with lots of colors, but the cost was high, and I don't
think Intel ever put the 82786 into serious production. </p>

<p>Then in 1984 I discovered Amiga and the infamous
&quot;boing!&quot; demo (at Siggraph at Moscone center). A
rotating, patterned sphere in real time with bounces off the
edges of the screen. (and sound too!) I saved my pennies and
bought an Amiga 1000. I loved that machine (and later the 2000)
for what it could do and what it represented in terms of hardware
accellerated graphics. I also was introduced to what was later to
become Lightwave by a guy who was rendering movies frame by frame
on his camcorder. A lot of work but the results were very cool,
not Siggraph movie quality, but pretty darn neat none-the-less.</p>

<p>I left Intel for Sun in 1986, and after several years Sun
introduced the SparcStation with the &quot;Lego&quot; board (you
know it as the GX card). This was a pretty neat setup, and it did
really fast fills using NURBS (non-uniform rational b-splines)
There was even a flight simulator demo that really rocked, boy
what 10+ MIPs and a graphics accellerator could do.</p>

<p>I then had a demo from a friend of mine (who had designed the
GX and later helped start NVida) of the NVidia NV1 which was sort
of like a GX board for PC compatibles. With great excitement and
anticipation I went out and bought it in the form of the Diamond
Edge 3D. video accellerator card. Big mistake. First the
developer's support was non-existent, and second Microsoft had
chosen a completely separate direction for Direct 3D (triangles
rather than NURBs), the final straw was D3D sucked rocks and not
just little rocks, big huge El Capitan sized granite rocks.</p>

<p>Now flash a bit farther forward, I'm reading gamespot.com and
they &quot;round up&quot; 3D accellerators looking at the Virge
DX, the NVidia NV1, a couple of others and the Voodoo Graphics.
Well the 3DFx based Monster 3D board blows everything out of the
water for benchmarks. I went out and bought one for $214.00.
Plugged it in, loaded it up and WOW I had really cool stuff going
on. When I ran the 3Dfx version of Tomb Raider I was just blown
away. I wanted to be able to build an environment like that! Then
I discovered that 3Dfx has a very accessible developer API called
Glide and I downloaded it and all the docs. In less than a day I
was drawing stuff on the screen and by the time the weekend was
over I was rotating a cube, now I had the means and the goal, all
I needed was the knowledge ...</p>
