<h1>Project: 3D Craft -- Node data structures</h1>

<p>As any student in computer science can tell you, linked lists
of things come in <em>really</em> handy. Especially when you
don't know ahead of time how many of the things you will need.
The use of linked lists in high performance graphics however is
somewhat controversial. On the one hand they provide an easy way
to express dynamically extensible lists of things like vertices,
on the other hand they are a bit slower to access than fixed
arrays. Because of this performance hit many people believe that
they have no place in an engine that expects to get the maximum
rendering performance out of the system.</p>

<p>My philosophy on nodes is simple, they make my life easier and
that is good. They make the code more flexible and that is good.
They slow things down a bit, and that is bad, but since I started
this project the speed of my &quot;desktop&quot; system has
doubled, so being a bit slower is irrelevant. </p>

<p>Finally, the current node system creates both singly and
doubly linked lists as well as sorted binary search trees with
the same node structure, however there are different function
calls for BSTs vs lists. This will be corrected in a later
release by adding typing information to the node structure.</p>

<hr>

<p>The following functions operated on nodes</p>

<p><em>p3dc_NODE *</em><strong>p3dc_new_node(</strong><em> void
*payload, char *name</em>, <em>int flags </em><strong>)</strong> </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>This function allocates a new node (possibly recovering it
    from the node free list) and assigns its <em>d</em> pointer
    to the <em>payload</em> and, if <em>name</em> is non-null,
    malloc's a string to hold a copy of the name. Initially the
    type is unknown. The only supported flag at the moment is <strong>P3DC_NODE_FREEPAYLOAD</strong>
    that causes the payload pointer to be freed with a called to
    either <em>p3dc_free_type</em> or <em>p3dc_free_list</em> (if
    its type is <strong>P3DC_LIST</strong>).</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>void </em><strong>p3dc_free_node(</strong><em> p3dc_NODE
*node </em><strong>)</strong> </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>This function frees the node passed to it, if the node has
    an allocated name it frees that as well. If the <em>free_payload
    </em>flag is true, it frees the payload pointer as well. If
    the type of node being freed is a list then <em>p3dc_free_list</em>
    is called on that node.</p>
