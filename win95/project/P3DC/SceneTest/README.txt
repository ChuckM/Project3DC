SceneTest is a demo that shows off multiple camera views
in P3DC. The upper left view is a fixed view, the upper
right view is movable by you the user, and the lower
left view is the view from behind and a bit below the
airplane. 

Move the user view using the arrow keys, 
	up/down - go up and down in world space (Y
		  axis)
	left/right - go left and right in world 
		  space (X axis) 
	ctrl+up/down - go forward and back in world 
		  space (Z axis)

The 'u' and 'd' keys will pitch the camera view from
behind the plane up or down. The 'l' and 'r' keys will
turn the camera behind the plane left or right.

You exit the demo by pressing the ESC key.

Enjoy,
